Star is the fastest tar archiver for UNIX

Star has many improvements compared to other tar 
implementations (including gnu tar). See below for a short description
of the highlight of star.

Star is located on:

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/star

Since Summer 2017, star offers more than 35 years of maintained service

Note that this project includes a stripped down version of libschily.
Do not try to link star dynamically against this library. If you like to link
dynamically, get the "schily" project bundle from:

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/

that includes a complete libschily.

Changes since star-1.5.3:

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, get a recent smake source and call
	in the smake directory tree:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


WARNING: the last separate star release has been 1.5.3 and this release was
published in 2014. Since then, frequent star updates have been available inside
the "schilytools" tar ball.

In case the "schily"-libraries are going to be installed as shared libraries,
is highly recommended to install star from the "schilytools" bundle instead of
using this star only archive. This is the only way to have the commonly used
code always at a recent development state.

	BUG WARNING: Please never report bugs to Linux distributions as they
		usually do not forward these bug reports upstream and as the
		Linux distributions typically do not let skilled people check
		the bugs. We did not hear about a FIFO problem in star for a
		long time and since the problem that (on Linux) occurred once
		every 6000-10000 tries did not happen on Solaris after
		10 million tries, it was not known otherwise.

This changelog may not be complete; for a complete changelog, please ceck the
changelog files from the schilytools. The changelog for the support libraries
and the build system has been taken from the SCCS-5.09 release and thus misses
the time-frame between October 1 2014 and May 21 2015.

	Short overview for what changed since the last "stable" version:

	-	Support for "infinitely" long path names has been added.

	-	Support for base-256 numbers in timestams and uid/gid
		has been added. This has been planned in the 1990s already,
		when star invented the base-256 coding, but it has been
		forgotten in favor of the POSIX.1-2001 enhanded archive
		headers.

	-	Support for comparing timestamps with nanosecond granularity

	-	-secure-links has been made the default when extracting
		archived (except when doing an incremental restore).

	-	Added Support for NFSv4 ACLs on FreeBSD. Solaris has been
		supported since 2013.

	-	Added Support to archive SELinix attributes.

	-	Allow to configure whether "star -fsync" is the default in
		order to support filesystems that are slow with granted
		transactions (like ZFS) or platforms that are genrally
		slow with fsync() (like Linux).

	-	Full UNICODE support has been added for tar headers.

	-	A new option cli=name (must be argv[1]) allows to select all
		supported command line interfaces (star, suntar, gnutar,
		pax, cpio) when called as star.

	-	Support for -zstd compression has been added.

	-	Support for -lzma compression has been added.

	-	Support for -freeze compression has been added.

	-	Some rare FIFO problems have been fixed.
		Note that we did recently run more than a billion tests to
		verify the FIFO after we identified a method to trigger the
		problem on Linux.

	-	A set of unit tests have been added.


/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

-	README.compile: added documentation on how to compile with clang

-	README.compile: completely reworked

-	READMEs/* updated

-	"installman" and other new targets have been added to the makefile
	system

-	New make rules for the "Bitrig" BSD distro

-	New make rules for the "Minix"

-	New make rules to permit 32 and 64 bit compilations on AIX

-	GCC makefile rules now all use the universal rule for 32 and 64 bit compilation

-	Support for WIN-NT-6.x added (Win-DOS Server 2008 ... Win-DOS 10)

-	Rules for the automated testing "make tests" added to the makefile system

-	autoconf: Various new configure tests

-	Schily Makefilesystem: Shared libraries now may have different numbers
	than "1" as part of the file name if the related Makefile includes
	definitions for SHL_MAJOR and SHL_MINOR. Plenty of RULES files have
	been updated to make this change effective.

	This is needed as we needed to introduce a binary incompatible libfind.
	See libfind below. All libs used to be hardwired to the filename
	"libxxx.so.1". Adding a SHL_MAJOR=2 to the shared library makefile
	(see libfind/shlfind.mk) ressults in a "libfind.so.2".

-	Schily Makefilesystem: Shared libraries for HP-UX are no longer only
	*.sl files but *.sl.$(SHL_MAJOR) with a symlink from *.sl to
	*.sl.$(SHL_MAJOR).

-	Schily Makefilesystem: Before the locale envorinment is set to "C",
	we now keep saved versions with the original content under OLD_LC_*

-	inc/avoffset.c: workaround against a clang bug that causes core cumps

-	sha3 support added to libmdigest

	to avoid undefined C behavior

-	include/schily/walk.h: various interface enhancements

-	include/schily/values.h: new include file.

-	include/schily/dbgmalloc.h: added more prototypes for libdbgmalloc.

-	libschily/ovstrcpy.c added

-	libschily/putenv.c added

-	libschily/unsetenv.c added

-	libschily/waitid.c added

-	libschily/wctype.c added

-	libschily/astoi.c and libschily/astoll.c now check for overflows
	and report ERANGE

-	libschily/*printf.c now support a locale dependent decimal separator

-	libschily/format.c (the printf worker code) has been enhanced to
	be faster with STDIO on most platforms.

-	libschily: getargs, getallargs and getfiles man pages have been reworked

-	libschily/getargs.c: combined single char boolean flags now work
	with callback type formats.

-	libschily/searchinpath.c added a new flag SIP_NO_STRIPBIN

-	libschily::breakline() fixed a bug that caused the return code to be
	larger than the number of array elements in some cases.

-	libschily::checkerr() added new category "ICONV"

-	libschily::comerr() A new environemtn variable "COMERR_EXCODE" disables
	exit code mapping of codes that cannot be returned via the outdated
	waitpid() call.

-	libschily::opendir() added a missing nul byte for the Win32 opendir()
	emulation

-	libschily::format() the schily printf implementation now prints
	floating point numbers in a POSIX compliant way.

-	libschily::fnmatch() a new algorithm avoids recursion and is much
	faster.
 
-	libschily::fnmatch() Support for [:alpha:] and similar has been added.

-	libschily::patmatch() Support for [:alpha:] and similar has been added.

-	libschily: resolvenpath() did not work as expected when some path names
	do not exist. A stat() call that should check whether we already
	reached the "/" directory caused a return (-1) even with
	(flags & RSPF_EXIST) == 0

-	libschily: Fixed the behavior of the umask/chmod perm parser for the
	case where "who" was not specified and the operator is '='. POSIX
	requires here to first clear all bits in the old value before adding
	new bits. The old implementation did clear only the bits retrieved
	from umask(2).

-	libschily: The umask/chmod perm parser now returns -1 for the mode
	string "u", since the operator is missing. Before, it just printed an
	error message but did not return -1.

-	libschily: astoul() and astoull() now by default permit to prefix
	the unsigned number by a "-". This is required by POSIX for strtoul()
	and strtoull() and our implementation needs to be compatible to POSIX
	to make the printf(1) implementation in the Bourne Shell POSIX
	compatible on older platforms.

	Thanks to Robert Elz for reporting
 
-	libschily: emulations for *at() have been fixed.

-	libschily/stdio/fgetstr.c now includes a speedup for AT&T stdio using
	the new movecbytes()

-	libschily/stdio/getdelim.c now includes a speedup for AT&T stdio using
	the new movecbytes()

-	libschily/ man pages reworked.

-	libschily::format.c The schily printf is now able to do %.*s with
	a significance > 8192 without overwriting the internal buffer.

	The new code is implemented via strnlen() and no longer copies
	the string - thus it should be even faster.

-	libschily::fnmatch.c: added a forgotten fix (from last January) for 
	a problem with missing brackets with if/then/else related to
	[:upper:] and [:lower:]

-	libschily::fnmatch.c:  added a forgotten _partial_ enhancement from
	last January for [= ... =] and [. ... .] support.

	Warning: this is not yet fully functional since the POSIX standard
	does not include an interface to get this functionality from the
	i18n part of libc.

-	libschily::match.c: Added a missing /* FALLTHROUGH */ comment.

	Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for poiting to a related Coverity message.

-	libschily::fstream.c: Added a /* NOTREACHED */ comment to make coverity
	quiet.

	Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for poiting to a related Coverity message.

-	libfind: the code now supports the *BSD enhancement "d_ino" in struct dirent.
	This speeds up stat()less jobs.

-	libfind: the code now supports the *BSD enhancement "d_type" in struct dirent.
	This speeds up stat()less jobs.

-	libfind: localization in libfind no longer affects the calling program

-	libfind: Arguments containing a '=' character did result in the related
	argument to become incremented inside the input arg vector. This caused
	problems with a free() loop on the arg vector.

	**********
	Warning: the fix causes a binary incompatibility as the struct finda_t
	changed it's size. As a result, we now install libfind.so.2 and changed
	the map file in order to require newer versions of the interface
	functions that are affected by the finda_t size change.
	**********

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	libfind: the -newer and -newerXY primaries now compare nanoseconds
	as well.

-	libfind: removed blank line in the linker map file

-	libfind: the id cache (uid/gid <->name mapping) now helps star to find
	whether a user name or group name is not completely 7 bit ASCII and
	thus needs a locale conversion in star POSIX.1-2001 extended headers.

-	libfind: Some open() calls now use O_DIRECTORY

-	libfind: walk.c now uses fchdir() on platforms that support dirfd(DIR*)
	and by this change, libfind is now aprox. 30% faster than before and
	makes libfind faster than other find implementations.

-	libfind: walk.c: "!isdot" has been renamed to "need_cd" for better
	readability of the code.

-	libfind: WALK_STRIPLDOT now strips even multiple occurences of "./" 
	and if there is no text after that, it replaces the empty string by ".".

-	libfind: new functions wstat() and wlstat() have been added (both are
	based on fstatat()).

-	libfind: treewalk() now works even without fa.walkflags |= WALK_CHDIR

-	libfind: The code compiles again on platforms without dirfd(), like
	e.g. DOS. On such a platform, there is currently however no way to
	use libfind without WALK_CHDIR.

-	libfind: Added a better ENAMETOOLONG discovery for the function
	dopendir() that is able to open a directory with a very long name.

-	libfind: In case of very long path names, the intermediate directories
	are now opened with O_SEARCH instead of O_RDONLY.

-	libfind/bsh/Bourne Shell: The "long" stat() implementation now works
	with absolute path names as well.

-	libfind: added support for a new feature: -call allows to do calls into
	the shell that started "find" as a builtin program. This is approx.
	40x faster than using -exec.

-	libfind: A new function walkcwd() allows to chdir() back from the start
	directory (that has been reached by calling walkhome()) to the
	directory where the treewalker has been before calling walkhome().

-	libfind: new source ptime.c

-	libfind: new source version.h

-	libfind: the major file name version number was bumped from 2 to 3
	since the new code causes binary incompatibility with the previous
	libfind.

-	libfind: A set of new primiary operators has been added:

	-newerat
	-newerct
	-newermt

	These primaries allow to check whether a file is newer than a time
	stamp description in it's argument. The argument to this primary
	is a date and time description that is similar to ISO 8601.

	The time description may look like:

                  yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.nnnnnnnnn+-zzzz

	for a time with timezone or

                  yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.nnnnnnnnnZ

        for GMT based time or

                  yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.nnnnnnnnn

        for local time.

	The 'T' may be replaced by a space. The description may be shortened
	from the right side, in this case the missing fields are assumed to 
	have the maximum value. It can be shortened from the left side and in
	that case, the missing fields are substituted by the current date.

	The call

		find . -newermt 2017

	will find all files with a modification time with the start of 2018
	or newer.

	The call

		find . -mewermt T

	will check for files that have a modification time of the start of
	tomorrow or newer.

-	libfind: The "-perm +mode" feature before has been recognised if the
	+ sign appeared before any character from  the set "ugoa", but since
	the string "+u" represents a POSIXly valid "permcopy" operation, the
	new version of libfind only accepts this specific feature if the
	mode string starts with a "a". Since (with find) the start value of
	the perm parser is 0, any valid mode string may be prefixed by "a+,"
	without changing the resulting value, the feature is usable with
	"-perm +a+,mode".

-	libfind: The phrase "-perm /mode" has been added as an alias for
	"-perm +mode", but since "/" is not permitted in a POSIX mode string,
	this methos does not require to prefix the mode string with "a+," to
	work. "-perm /mode" also helps to give comptibility with GNU find.

-	libfind: "-chmod mode" no longer causes a wrong treatment in some
	cases as the special treatment for "-perm +mode" no longer applies
	to -chmod too.

-	libfind: new function find_strvers() returns the version string.

-	libfind: version bumped to 1.7

-	libfind: treewalk() now supports a new flag WALK_MOUNTPLUS.

	This new flag reports mount points but does not descend into them.

	The existing flag WALK_MOUNT does not report mount points and does
	not descend into them.

	The background for this change is:

	1)	"star -cM ..." and "star -c -find . -xdev ..." differ
		in their behavior and there was no way to get the
		star -M behavior from libfind.

	2)	The POSIX standard for "find -xdev ..." is in conflict
		with the documented behavior for "find -xdev ..." on
		UNIX and with the documented and POSIX standard behavior
		of nftw() with the FTW_MOUNT flag (The UNIX find(1) 
		implementation is based on nftw()).

	3)	There is a general need to have the other behavior where
		mount points are reported.

-	libfind: find(1) gets a new primary operator "-mount+" as a
	supplement to the historic UNIX "-mount" behavior that is based
	on WALK_MOUNT. -mount+ is based on WALK_MOUNTPLUS

-	libfind: Added a date to the -version output and added version.h

-	libfind/star/mkisofs/bsh/Bourne Shell: "find -xdev" is no longer
	UNIX compatible but rather POSIX compatible.

	*** Incompatible change ***
	*** POSIX wording from 1992 is in conflict with UNIX implementation ***

	Background: POSIX in 1992 introduced a wording for -xdev that was in
	conflict with existing implementations and required a behavior that
	is impossible to implement with nftw(3).

	Today, half of the implementations follow the UNIX rules and half of
	the implementations follow the POSIX text.

	To solve the conflict, POSIX decided to add the old UNIX "find -mount"
	(that was intended as an alias to "find -xdev") and to be implemented
	with the old UNIX behavior and requires "find -xdev" to follow the
	POSIX text from 1992. At the same time, POSIX introduced a new nftw(3)
	flag FTW_XDEV as a complement to FTW_MOUNT with the behavior that
	matches the POSIX requirements for "find -xdev".

	As a result, libfind now makes -xdev an alias to -mount+ and keeps
	the -mount primary with the old behavior. The difference is:

	-mount	does not lists mount points at all and does not descend
		into them.

	-xdev	lists directories that are mount points but does not
		descend into these directories.

-	libfind: walkcwd() no longer tries to call dirfd() unless it exists or
	DIR->dd_fd exists.

	This should make it compile with DJGPP again.

-	libfind: the time parser now supports the new time spec "now" for
	the current time.

-	libfind: The new primaries -chatime, -chctime, -chmtime allow to
	set the time stamps in struct stat to arbitrary values.

-	libfind: A new primaries -chfile allows to set the modified struct
	stat values from -chown, -chgrp, -chmod, -chatime, -chctime, -chmtime
	to the file.

	On platforms where chmod() is not possible on a symbolic link, symbolic
	links are skipped with that change.

	On platforms where it is not possible to set times on symbolic links,
	symbolic linkes are skipped with that change.

-	libfind: Added support for being able to use simple shell scripts
	(scripts that do not start with a #! line) as commands for the
	-exec and -exec + primaries.

	This requires a reordering of the arg vector and to insert a "sh"
	as new argv[0] before the original arguments.

-	libfind: added a new timestamp to the libfind version.

-	libfind::find.c: Added a missing /* FALLTHROUGH */ comment.

	Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for poiting to a related Coverity message.

-	libdeflt: avoid a double fclose(dfltfile)

-	librmt: a new function rmtrsh() has been added to set up a different
	method to initiate a remote connection. This allows to tell librmt
	to make connections with "ssh" instead of using "rcmd()" or "rsh".

	Thanks to a hint from Kristýna Streitová <kstreitova@suse.com>
 
-	librmt: a new function rmtrmt() has been added to set up a different
	path to the remote rmt server program. This allows to tell librmt
	to make connections to servers that are on a path other than "/etc/rmt".
 
-	librmt: The man pages have been enhanced.


-	Fixed a bug in star's pax CLI that caused spax -X to dump core.
	Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for reporting.

-	The programs cdrecord, star and cdda2wav adopt to the recent Haiku
	changes with a randomized address space and now use B_EXACT_ADDRESS
	instead of B_ANY_ADDRESS for the clone_area() call to get shared memory
	for a FIFO.

-	star now again stores up tp 16 bytes for uname in the old star
	archive format - not null terminated in case all bytes are used.

-	star -diff now correctly deals with the non null-terminated uname/gname
	strings from the old star archive format.

-	mkisofs and star have also been corrected to use
	S_IFCTG and S_ISCTG instead of the S_IFCNT and S_ISCNT

-	star now flushes the verbose file stream before checking for missing
	links. This tries to avoid mixed output when people call
		star  2>&1 | tee

-	star: avoid a warning from GCC-4.8.3

-	star/acltext.c: fixed a memory leak in case that malloc() failed
	in acltotext().
	Thanks to heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	Star now supports "star -copy -find /from ... /to"
	Thanks to a report from Stéphane Chazelas. A minor piece of code
	was forgotten when the final -find integration did take place.

-	Star now supports "-C directory" before a -find option. This allows to
	call e.g.:
		star -copy -C /from/path -find . /to/path

	and thus permits to avoid long path prefixes to be copied into the
	/to/path hierarchy.

-	Star now calls setlocale() and thus correctly supports -find -name
	with multibyte locales.
	Thanks to a report from Stéphane Chazelas.

-	star: Manpage now mentions star_sym and tartest in the SEE ALSO section

-	Star: star in "-dump" mode and when using the FIFO did overwrite the 
	tar header for a file with the POSIX.1-2001 extended tar header for
	efficiency. This unfortumately did overwrite data that was later 
	used by:

		star -c -dump -vv

	for the verbose listing and caused username/groupname to be "root".
	We no longer allocate the PTB from the FIFO buffer in this case and
	introduce a minor performance penalty when using "star -c -vv".

-	Star: now calling strlcpy() instead of strcpy() when copying CPIO
	file names as CPIO has no checksum and may observe rotten archives.
	Thanks to Hanno Böck for the report.

-	Star: Only check CPIO-BIN filenames for swapped bytes when the filename
	would fit into a 512 byte header. Cpio officially only support 256 bytes
	in the filename. In theory 65k is possible but with star -no-fifo,
	we only have 10k to check.
	Thanks to Hanno Böck for the report.

-	Star: Abort with CPIO-BIN archives when the symlink target name size is
	seen as a number <= 0 in the cpio header. This avoids a core dump from
	rotten CPIO archives.
	Thanks to Hanno Böck for the report.

-	Star: When using the outdated signed checksums, star could incorrectly
	assume that a block o characters that sums up to 0 is an EOF block.
	Star now defines such a block as a potential EOF block and repeats the
	the computation using unsigned chars to verify whether it really is
	an EOF block.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for the report.

-	Star: Avoid to read cpio file names and link names that are longer
	than PATH_MAX.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for the report.

-	Star: check for EOF while trying to read long TAR filenames.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for the report.

-	Star: avoid to access the name field in the historical tar header.
	This could cause directories not to be recognized because the 
	name field could be non-null terminated.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for the report.

-	Star: try to avoid accessing data from outside the uname/gname fields
	in case a broken tar archive is used. Star now inserts a null byte at the
	end to prevent str*() functions to scan the data with probably no end.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for the report.

-	Star: try to avoid data from outside a tar header while looking for an
	octal number in a field that does not contain the expected characters.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for the report.

-	Star: In list mode, use longer character arrays to convert the
	link count, uname and gname. The linkcount array did miss the
	space for a space character.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for the report.

-	Star: Abort when a CPIO archive claims to havea zero sized filename.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for the report.

-	Star: star -i no longer tries to access memory before the file name
	array when the file name field starts with a nul byte.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for the report.

-	Star: Check whether the devminorbits value is reasonable to avoid
	an array out of bound read access.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for the report.

-	Star: remove a left over debug printf in create.c that was inserted
	while fixing the star -dump -vv bug in schilytools-2016-06-28.

-	Star: The man page now includes a link to the star sources.

-	Star: Add support for NFSv4 ACLs on FreeBSD based on a patch from
	Martin Matuska <martin@matuska.org>

-	star: Linux xattrs are now set after chown() as Linux resets xattrs
	with a chown() call.
	Thanks to Kristýna Streitová <kstreitova@suse.com>

-	star: fixed a typo in star.4

-	star: The string conversion from the POSIX.1-2001 extended header
	SCHILY.filetype has been speed up with a string length table.

-	star: fixed a bug with star -r and star -u that could cause star to
	use the wrong offset for appending to the archive which then created
	an unappendable archive.
	Thanks to Steffen Nurpmeso <steffen@sdaoden.eu> for reporting.

-	star: A workaround in star for a SSH TCP-IP problem seen on Linux in
	2003 is now disabled by default but may be activated by setting the
	environment STAR_WORKAROUNDS=ssh-tcpip

-	star: The man page now documents that ZFS and other COW filesystems
	slow down in extract mode by the star default of calling fsync(fd)
	for every file.

-	star: the README files in the directory testscripts now mention
	sourceforge instead of berlios.

-	star: a first version of a test suite has been added

-	star: testscripts 

-	star: table.c & table.h: changed some tables from signed char
	to uint8_t as the values are used as index for other tables.

-	star: The NFSv4 ACL format was redesigned following a proposal from
	Martin Matuska <martin@matuska.org> from FreeBSD.

	The new format omits the '-' signs in the output from

		acl_totext(aclp, ACL_COMPACT_FMT | ACL_APPEND_ID | ACL_SID_FMT);

	to save space in order to be able to hold more ACL entries in a
	single 512 byte block. This change actually permits most files to have
	all meta data inside a single 512 byte block with extended TAR data.

-	star: star.1 Now uses 4-digit year numbers for the last changed date

-	star: star.4 Now uses 4-digit year numbers for the last changed date

-	star: star.4 documents the new ACL format for NFSv4 ACLs.

-	star: The conformance tests that check the star -tv behavior now set
	the timezone to GMT to get a test result that does not depend on the
	configured timezone of the system.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	tartest fixed some GCC warnings for unused variables.

-	TARGETS/55star_sym added a newline to make "make tinfo" work when
	/bin/sh is not a classical Bourne Shell. The code worked before because
	there was a bug in the classical Bourne Shell with sh -ce cmd.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	star: added a missing '{' in commented out code.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	Star (pax): Option parsing is now done in a POSIX compliant way.
	Before, pax did not permit calls like "pax -vffile".

	This is the first step in making star's pax implementation
	to pass the POSIX certification.

-	star: Added a new extended header: SCHILY.devminorbits
	This is needed because Solaris uses a different makedev() for 64 bit
	commands and 32 bit commands.

	The new SCHILY.devminorbits allows to convert struct stat.st_dev
	as used by SCHILY.dev into a number that is compatible to the system
	used by the local program. Note that SCHILY.dev is currently not
	used in extract mode, but a value in the archive that does not fit
	into the local dev_t type was flagged by star. This caused a warning
	like this:
	
	star: WARNING: SCHILY.dev '124554051655' in extended header at 3 exceeds local range.

	when the archive created by a 64 bit star on Solaris was fed into
	a 32 bit star.

	Ad a result, tar archives from 64 bit star binaries and 32 bit star
	binaries are now compatible.

-	include/schily/device.h: XDEV_T is now Ullong. This file was forgotten
	to distribute with schilytools-2017-10-10. The change is however needed
	for a bugfix in "star".

-	star: When in list or diff mode on an "exustar" typed archive, star did
	believe a hardlinked symlink is both hardlink and symlink but only the
	hardlink target is present in the archive. We thus only list or compare
	the hardlink now.

-	star: When star is in interactive extract mode, it now asks for file
	removal in case that the attempt to create a new file returns ELOOP.
	This helps to extract archives that change the current symlink
	structure and that may result in an intermediate endless symlink loop.

-	star: Avoiding a warning from the HP-UX K&R compiler

-	star: A problem in btrfs on Linux may cause stat.st_blocks == 0 for
	huge files that start with a big hole and end with data. While this
	seems to be a bug in btrfs (stat.st_blocks has been reported to
	become != 0 later), there is the theoretical case where a huge hole
	is followed by data that may fit in compressed form into the "inode"
	and legally result in stat.st_blocks == 0.

	We thus disabled the F_ALL_HOLE test. A modern filesystem should
	implement support for SEEK_HOLE, for performance reasons. Note that
	SEEK_HOLE exists since 13 years already. An operating system or
	filesystem that today does not support SEEK_HOLE must be seen as
	outdated.

-	star/pax.c: Removed a leftover debug print statement that was added in
	September 2017 while adding support for the POSIX option parser
	requirement that the last character in a combined option string may
	have an argument.

	Thanks to Leah Neukirchen for reporting.

-	star: Fixed some typos

	Thanks to Leah Neukirchen for reporting.

-	star: we now add a null byte past a possible tar checksum in the first
	header while trying to find out which archive type is in use.

	This avoids useless warnings: "WARNING: Unterminated octal number at..."
	with cpio archives. The bug and the message have been introduced in
	July 2016.

-	star: 64 new unit tests for archive autodetection have been added

-	star: star_fat.mk has been enhanced to import newer content from
	Makefile

-	star: star.mk has been enhanced to import newer content from
	Makefile

-	star: cpiohdr.c and the star man page have been modified to explain
	that the CPIO CRC archive format uses a 32-bit checksum and no CRC.

-	star: A new message "Badly formed number '%s'.\n" has been introduced to
	help to identify illegal arguments to complex options like fs=.

-	star: The man page has been enhanced in order to reduce the chance
	to missunderstand descriptions.

-	star: We now better check for the results of an ignored SIGTTIN

	Thanks to Robert Clausecker for reporting.

-	star: star -diff is now able to compare nanoseconds in timestamps.
	This requires a tar archive with full POSIX.1-2001 extended tar
	header extensions. If the archive does not include sub-second
	resolution, star -diff implements a silent fallback to what previously
	has been done: just compare the seconds.

-	various files: as a side effect of the new nanosecond resolution in
	smake and star, many files in this distribution did get an updated
	CDDL header with an additional URL

		http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cddl1.txt

-	star: Since 1985, star by default only extracts files from an
	archive if they are newer than the file on disk. The check whether
	files in the archive are newer than in the filesystem has been
	extended. Star now checks nanoseconds as well when in extract mode
	in case the archive contains timestamps with sub-second resolution.

	Warning: since historic tar archives store timestamps only with
	second resolution, extrating such an archive results in files that
	have the nanoseconds of the timestamps set to 0. If you later extract
	another archive with POSIX.1-2001 extenden headers that include
	nanosecond timestamps, all files on disk are considered to be older
	than the same files in the archive and thus extracted again.

	Note that since an incremental back usually takes much longer than a
	second, star currently still only compares seconds in the timestamps
	of files when deciding whether a file is put into an incremental
	backup. Files that have been created with the same second timestamp
	as the start of the last incremental are included in the next
	incremental, so no file is lost because of this decision.

-	star: The nanosecond handling in append mode has been verified and
	the related comment has been enhanced.

-	star: "star -c -newer ..." now checks nanoseconds as well.

-	star: Added a new archive format "epax". This is the same as "pax",
	but it always includes a POSIX.1-2001 extended header with timestamps
	with nanosecond resolution.

-	star: Better comment in unicode.c

-	star.c: unicode.c is now based on iconv() to permit other locale encodings
	than ISO-8859-1

-	star: The POSIX.1-2001 extended header keyword hdrcharset=BINARY now
	works.

-	star: When in copy mode, star now uses hdrcharset=BINARY to avoid charset
	conversion problems.

-	star: Now using version 1.5.4

-	star: user name, group name, path and linkpath are now automatically
	added to the POSIX.1-2001 extended header in case that they include
	non-ASCII characters (outside the 7-bit range).

-	star: if mtime is negative, mtime is too large for a POSIX.1-1988
	TAR header or if nanoseconds are non-null and the archive format
	supports POSIX.1-2001 extended headers, the times are now always
	recorded in an extended header. This is a requirement from newer
	POSIX versions.

-	star: Since the probability for creating POSIX.1-2001 x-headers
	did raise, we cannot make assumptions anymore just from the existence
	of an x-header. While doing archive format detection, star is no longer
	happy with a 'x' or 'g' header to decide that an archive is in
	"exustar" format but requires a SCHILY.archtype keyword.

-	star: The fifo is now using a better autoconfiguration in order to
	prevent it to try to use shmget() on DOS. This makes star compile 
	with DJGPP.

-	star: a new option (-pax-o) has been added. This currently only 
	implelents the flag "binary" that tells star to add a field
	hdrcharset=BINARY to the extended headers.

-	star: better comment in Makefile

-	star: fixed an ununitialized finfo.f_flags in flush_link()

	Thanks to Martin Liska from Suse for reporting

-	star: updated the mail addresses in the man pages.

-	mt: updated the mail addresses in the man pages.

-	rmt: updated the mail addresses in the man pages.

-	star: add $(LIB_ICONV) to the Makefile

-	star: man pages no longer have star(4/5) in the SEE ALSO section but
	star(4), so the automatic links from man2html(1) work.

-	star: the function has_dotdot() that checks for dangerous filenames
	that contain ../../ which has been written 15 years ago (as the first
	tar archiver to make this security check), now also checks for ..\..
	attacks on Cygwin and other DOS based platforms.

-	star: added a check for the exit code from the compress rogram. This
	helps to detect certain problems and to make star exit != 0 in such a
	case. The current code is based on siginfo_t. This is a "new" feature
	that has been introduced by SVr4 in 1989 and that has been standardized
	by SUSv1 in 1995. So it needs an OS platform that is actively
	maintained after the period 1989/1995.

	Thanks to a hint from Kristýna Streitová <kstreitova@suse.com>

-	star: A hard EOF on the input now causes star to exit with a non-zero
	exit code. This is a fallback method to grant a non-zero exit code
	on platforms with an unmaintained kernel (such as Linux) where still
	no working waitid()/siginfo_t exists even though the feature has been
	introduced in 1989 (29 years ago).

-	star: The Makefile now contains a #define "USE_SSH" to compile in
	a new default to make remote tape connections using the ssh protocol
	by default instead of the previous "rsh".

	Thanks to a hint from Kristýna Streitová <kstreitova@suse.com>

-	star: A new option rsh=path has been added to specify a different
	remote login program on the command line.

	WARNING: since the new default for star is to use "ssh", users that
	rely on the speed of a rcmd() connection need to either put an empty
	RSH= variable into the environment or need to specify rsh='' on the
	star command line.

-	star: A new option rmt=path has been added to specify a different
	path to the remote tape server program on the command line.

	Since star defaults to the UNIX default path "/etc/rmt", for the server
	at the remote side, and since most /etc/rmt implementations are
	dangerous in case that the OS on server and client differ, it is
	recommended to put "RMT=/opt/schily/sbin/rmt" into the environment or
	to specify "rmt=/opt/schily/sbin/rmt" on the star command line.

-	star: The environment STAR_FSYNC=N may establish a default in star
	that enables -no-fsync by default in order to prevent star from being
	slow on a platform with inefficient buffer cache (like Linux) or on
	transactional copy on write filesystem like ZFS.

	Note that on Solaris with UFS, the performance degradation from using
	the reliable mode (and issuing fsync()) is much less than 10%, while on
	Linux with the UFS clone EXT4, the performance degradation is 400%.

	If this fsync()-less default is enabled, star is always faster than other
	archivers that never had such a check, but may no longer detect whether a
	file could not be extracted correctly, since not all problems can be
	flagged in the close() return code.
	

-	star: The entry STAR_FSYNC=N in /etc/default/star may establish a 
	default in star were -no-fifo is enabled by default.

-	star: A new option -do-fsync may reverse the default from the
	STAR_FSYNC=N environment or from /etc/default/star.

-	rmt: the man page has been enhanced.

-	rmt: the comment in the program has been enhanced.

-	tartest: Some warnings that have been printed to stderr are now on stdout
	to make them all appear in the same file.

-	star_sym: added the O_DIRECTORY openflag

-	star::pathname.c: New function strlcpy_pspace() helps to implement
	path names of arbitrary length more efficient.

-	star::pathname.c: make the realloc() implementation more correct
	with respect to all return possible codes specified by POSIX.

-	star::unicode.c: iconv() results are now terminated with a '\0' byte

-	star::unicode.c: _from_utf8() now honors "fromlen". This is needed
	for the new POSIX.1-2001 extended header handling.

-	star::subst.c: The code has been rewritten to use strlcpy() instead of
	strncpy().

-	star::subst.c: The code no longer uses the result path storage for
	getting the result from Y/N questions.

-	star::subst.c: -s'/from/to/g' did only substitute once, while
	-s'/from/to&/g' did work as expected.

-	star::subst.c: There is no longer any limitation on the length of the 
	path as long as there is sufficient memory for malloc().

-	star::subst.c: The path name read function has been rewritten to use
	getdelim().

-	star::buffer.c Added a new error message in checkerrs() for a buffer
	overflow in path name substitution.

-	star::dirtime.c: new function flushdirtimes() allows to flush the dir
	stack as a callback from the comexit() procedure.

-	star::dirtime.c: the code is now able to handle file names with
	unlimited length even though the low level calls to utimes() and chmod()
	still may result in an ENAMETOOLONG.

-	star::pathname.h: This file now is also able to work in case stdio.h has
	not been included before.

-	star: added several functions as callback for comexit() to give better
	messages when star is terminated by severe problems.

-	star: the man page now prints the star magic 'tar\0' in bold chars.

-	star: The archive type tests have been adopted to the slightly different
	output format in case of errors. We now print buffer statistics in
	such a case.

-	star: The first stage of code rework for unlimited path len has been
	implemented for the "extract" case (list, extract, diff, append). The
	code may still cause an ENAMETOOLONG error.

	The next planned stages:

	-	Make "star -c -find . ..." able to archive path names of
		arbitrary length.

	-	Add methods to avoid ENAMETOOLONG in extract or diff mode.

	-	Make "star -c . ..." able to archive path names of
		arbitrary length.

	-	Make Make "star -c . ..." as fast as "star -c -find . ..."

-	star: SELinux support has been added. The related code is based on code
	that was most likely written by

		Daniel Walsh <dwalsh@redhat.com>

	The code has been reported to the star team by

		Kristýna Streitová <kstreitova@suse.com>

	Note that the new code correctly clears inherited SELinux attributes
	for files that haveno such attributes in the archive. So it is
	important to upgrade.

-	star: the SELinux support was revised with feedback from
	Pavel Raiskup <praiskup@redhat.com>

-	star: star -version on Linux now prints:

	star: star 1.5.4 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)

	Options: acl-POSIX.1e-draft find fflags remote Linux-xattr SELinux

	and make it visible whether there is SELinux support compiled in.

-	star: a typo in acl_unix.c has been fixed. This typo could in
	rare situations cause a buffer overflow as the wrong strlen() was
	checked.

	Thanks to Pavel Raiskup <praiskup@redhat.com> for reporting

-	star: converted the code in preparation for a localization.
	star now calls the new gt*() functions wit builtin gettext()
	call for the format string.

	This has been done for most cases by a #define GT_COMERR
	and #define GT_ERROR

	In some special cases, there are calls to gtprintf() and fgtprintf().

-	Shells & star long pathname enhancements:

		These enhancements have been implemented in a way that
		they do not affect the behavior with pathnames shorter
		than PATH_MAX.

		If a very long path name is encountered, things become
		slow since this typically results in hopping over a dozen
		or more single openat() calls.

		Star may have general problems as a result from new dynamic
		path name storage handling.

		Star did not yet replace all static path name stuff by
		dynamic path handling but the typical usage should be covered
		by the current state. What is missing is support for
		-install, file unlinking and file renaming.

		Star may have problems with long path names under some
		rare conditions.

-	star: new functions lchdir() & lgetcwd() have been added for dealing
	with very long path names with the -C option.

-	star: the option list= is now implemented using getdelim() and thus
	supports to read arbitrary path name length from files or stdin.

-	star: volhdrs are now without a PATH_MAX limit.

-	star: added a new function _lgetinfo() that always does an lstat()
	independent of -L and -h. This is needed in order to check whether
	a filesystem object exists and needs to be deleted before extraction.

-	star: line reading functions that deal with the inode database in
	"star-symtable" in the incremental restore code now support arbitrary
	line length.

-	star: the "remove" code now supports to remove file system trees of
	arbitrary depth and path length.

-	star: incremental restores, in case they are not run as root, could
	under some rare cases (nearly full target filesystem) when inode
	numbers are reused faster than usual, result in "permission denied"
	errors while extracting files.

	This happened when such a reused inode has no write permission for
	the owner. A similar case with changing file type has been fixed
	in February 2005 as the only bug that ever appeared in star's
	incremental backup/restore system fater incrementals have been
	introduced in September 2004. Since February 2005, we remove files
	with a different type before we create new ones.

	As we previously assumed that incremental restores are always run
	as root, this permission problem did never cause any harm in the
	past. This is since root is allowed to create files in readonly
	directories and since root can write into readonly files.

	We now first run a chmod() +w on directories and files with no
	write permissions before we extract the content.

	This modification now allows star to be used for private backups
	and restores without the need to become root for the task.

-	star_sym: Added a new function osmode() because restore.c now
	needs this function because of the above change and we do not like
	to add star_unix.c to star_sym.

-	star: Previously, star needed the option -force-restore in order to
	restore partial dumps. A new option -partial now allows partial
	restores without at the same time permitting dump level mismatches
	or reference date mismatches.

-	star: star -Hgnutar now also creates long path names. GNU tar-1.30
	started to create long path names under some conditions, even though
	it is unable to extract archives with long path names. Our archives
	thus are not more challenging to GNU tar than archives created
	by GNU tar itself ;-)

-	star: mention the GNU tar long path name problem in the man page.

-	star: mktemp() destroys it's argument even when it fails because
	of ENAMETOOLONG. We need to save and restore the original name
	argument to make our long path workaround working.

-	star: "star -x -install ..." now works with very long path names
	as we have a mktemp() workaround for long path names.

-	star: Long names using the pre-POSIX long pathname header method now 
	works since the related extraction routine in longname.c now manages
	dynamic path store as well.

-	star: extraction with symlink emulation (that creates copies) now also
	supports long path names.

-	star: incremental restores now support long path names.

-	star: "star -c" (without "-find") is now able to handle long
	path names. This is the final change to make star a fully long path
	name supporting program.

-	star: star_unix.c: a new function getinfoat() has been added.
	It uses fstatat() if this function supported by the current platform
	and not emulated in libschily.

-	star: "star -c" now uses fstatat() via getinfoat() if possible.
	This causes a 30% performance win in case of "star -c -onull" and
	makes "star -c" now nearly as fast as "star -c -find".

-	star: pathname.c: New function clear_pspace()

-	star: star -xattr now aborts with an error message that -xattr
	is reserved for NFSv4 xattrs and that Linux needs -xattr-linux

-	star long path name state report:

	-	All known places that previously used static path name store
		or system calls directly have been converted to use dynamic
		path storage and long path name aware functions. This has been
		extended to any place (even those locations that never reach
		ENAMETOOLONG) in order to be able to verify the correctness
		of the change via "nm".

	-	Most long path name features work even on older platforms if
		at least fchdir() is supported, so this does not need a very
		recent platform.

	-	Hard links between long path names only work on platforms
		that natively support the linkat() system call.

	-	The code is not yet optimized for good performance and is
		currently approx. 30% slower when long paths (> PATH_MAX) are
		actually used.

-	star: using -xattr now only prints a hint on -xattr-linux in case
	that this happens on a platform that does not support NFSv4 Extended
	Attribute files, e.g. Linux.

-	star: using -xattr on a platform with NFSv4 Extended Attribute files
	now prints that this feature is not yet supported in star.

-	star: Release 2018-07-16 caused star not to compile anymore on Mac OS X.
	This is because sys/xattr.h on Linux and sys/xattr.h on Mac OS X are
	very similar but incompatible.

	A first quick fix, was to disable Linux xattr support in case that
	XATTR_NOFOLLOW is defined (which is part of the incompatibility).

	Since things did look simple, we now support these simple xattr method
	on Mac OS X as well.

-	star: Release 2018-07-16 introduced a bug in the diff code that caused
	star to dump core while comparing symbolic links. Since the symlink
	target name cannot be longer than PATH_MAX, we are now using a static
	path buffer again in this case.

-	star: The routines that read Y/N answers now use fgetstr() instead of
	fgetline() in order to detect a buffer overrun.

	In case of an overrun, we now read until a newline is seen, in order to
	get a new sane start for the next question.

-	star: New file version.c include a datefield besides the version
	number.

-	star: The star archive format man page has been updated to match the
	current state.

-	star: The archive format detection for the XUSTAR format now also
	checks for base 256 numbers in atime/ctime.

-	bsh/Bourne Shell/star: a very long path name could cause a core dump
	with a "chdir()" operation in some cases, as there was no check for
	pointer != NULL when restoring the '/' character while hopping over
	parts of the path name.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	star: "star -c H=exustar -pax-o binary" now correctly results in
	unencoded strings for uname/gname/path/linkpath. There was preliminary
	code for the -copy mode but the final changes for this binary mode
	have been forgotten. This was caused by a change of a variable name 
	from "copyflag" to "binflag" in May 2018.

	WARNING: If you created archives during the past three months using the
	option "-pax-o binary", you definitely need to recreate the archives
	in case there are non-ascii characters in values for the named 
	keywords.

-	star: The code to set the time stamp for extracted files has been
	changed to correctly deal with symbolic links.

	In former times, time stamps for symlinks have not been set at all
	as there was n way to do that.

	Later, with the availability if utimensat() This could be done for
	symlinks as well, if the target systen supports utimensat().

	Recently, the code was rearranged to always use utimensat(), but
	to use an emulation on older systems. This resulted in sometimes
	setting the timestamp of the symlink target instead of the
	symlink, depending on how the emulation could be implemented.

	The new code knows how the emulation is done and avoids to set
	the times for the symlink targets on older platforms where the
	emulation does not (cannot) support to set the time of symlinks.

	Thanks to Stephane Chazelas for reporting.

-	star: star -x -to-stdout no longer tries to set the "not extracted"
	file to Jan 1 1970 in case of an extraction error.

-	star: The option -secure-links has been made the default except when
	extracting dumps with the -restore option.

	The reason for that change is that a handcrafted tar archive could
	first include a symlink with absolute target name, e.g. x -> /etc
	and then include a file x/passwd that would be extracted using 
	the 'x' link to result in /etc/passwd.

	Our solution with -secure-links is the same since 20 years: do not
	extract the problematic symlink and as a result, the later file 
	will be extracted into the local directory tree.

-	star: a new option -no-secure-links allows to disable the secure
	default behavior.

-	star: Added a new help output to the error statistics in case that
	a file has been skipped because it contains /../ or when a symbolic
	link has been skipped because it points to an absolute path or
	because the symlink target contains /../. This help-text mentions
	the options -.. and -secure-links respectively.

-	star: the archive format man page now correctly explains that in 
	BINRAY mode, the values for uname/gname/path/linkpath are not 
	coded in UTF-8.

-	star: The README file now mentions very long path names and
	uses recent mail addresses

-	star: the function getpriv() has been renamed to getpaxpriv()
	since a function getpriv() is part of libc on OS400.

	Thanks to Jack Woehr for reporting

-	libfind/star/mkisofs/bsh/Bourne Shell: "find -xdev" is no longer
	UNIX compatible but rather POSIX compatible.

	*** Incompatible change ***
	*** POSIX wording from 1992 is in conflict with UNIX implementation ***

	Background: POSIX in 1992 introduced a wording for -xdev that was in
	conflict with existing implementations and required a behavior that
	is impossible to implement with nftw(3).

	Today, half of the implementations follow the UNIX rules and half of
	the implementations follow the POSIX text.

	To solve the conflict, POSIX decided to add the old UNIX "find -mount"
	(that was intended as an alias to "find -xdev") and to be implemented
	with the old UNIX behavior and requires "find -xdev" to follow the
	POSIX text from 1992. At the same time, POSIX introduced a new nftw(3)
	flag FTW_XDEV as a complement to FTW_MOUNT with the behavior that
	matches the POSIX requirements for "find -xdev".

	As a result, libfind now makes -xdev an alias to -mount+ and keeps
	the -mount primary with the old behavior. The difference is:

	-mount	does not lists mount points at all and does not descend
		into them.

	-xdev	lists directories that are mount points but does not
		descend into these directories.

-	star: changed the members of struct dumpdates to have the prefix dd_ in
	all members.

-	star: Enhanced the comment in fifo.c and fifo.h

-	star: Added "volatile" to a selection of struct members in struct m_head.
	This should help to avoid specific optimization from newer compilers
	that could cause problems with the synchronization of the fifo.

-	star: added new flag members (eflags & pflags) to struct m_head to make
	sure that the probability of changing too much with &= and |= operators
	in only a single flag word is reduced. We added:

	eflags	for flags that are only used in preparation of an exit

	pflags	for flags that are modified only by the put side of the FIFO
		when doing changes at unpredictive time slots.

-	star: make sure that "star -c" results in a non-zero exit code if it
	is interupted by ^C.

	Note that star catches ^C in order to avoid to create defective tar
	archives (similar to a GNU tar bug) in such a case, but previously 
	behaved like SunOS tar that finishes with the current file, writes
	a correct EOF record to the archive and then exits  with 0.

	The star exit code in case of a ^C with star -c is -4.

-	star: Added new code to allow to debug a hanging FIFO.

	If the FIFO hangs, use "ps -efc| grep star" to find the two process
	IDs for the two star processes and then call:

		kill -RTMAX <pid1>
		kill -RTMAX <pid2>

	and report the output that appears after sending this signal to both
	processes.

-	star: the path name length and the link name length are now set from
	the POSIX 2001 extended tar headers in case that a name appears in that
	extended meta data. This may speed up thigs that need to know the path
	name length.

-	star: Star now retrieves the current working directory in extract mode.
	If this fails, it is not seen as a severe error and star continues to
	work.

-	star: the behavior for links in the default case (with
	-secure-links active) has been made more user friendly.

	Star now only flags links that point outside the current working
	directory. This makes all tar extractions in default mode safe as long
	as they are done inside an empty diretory.

-	star: various Cstyle changes

-	star: documented the new primaries -chatime, -chctime, -chmtime

	These primaries allow to archive files with aribitrary time stamps.

	If you e.g. like to archive all files with the current time, use:

		star -c -find . -chmtime now

-	star: A typo in the function dolchmodat() has been fixed. The bug has been
	introduced in July 2018 while adding support for very long path names.

	dolchmodat() is needed/used when a platform uses different file mode
	bits than defined by POSIX. In this case, the fix allows to compile
	star with DJGPP again.

-	star: added a new timestamp to the star version.

-	star: The man page now mentions incremental backups and restores in the
	FEATURES section.

-	smt: smt -wready now checks whether the last open really failed before
		retrying the open operation.

		Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for reporting this coverity result.

-	star: hole.c: A memory leak in in hole.c::put_sparse() has been fixed.

		Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for reporting this coverity result.

-	star: xheader.c: the macro scopy() no longer has a semicolon at the end.

		Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for reporting this coverity result.

-	star: added support for auto detection of "zstd" compressed archives.

-	star: added a new option -zstd to support compression and uncompression
	using the program "zstd".

-	star: Recently, star did hang in the FIFO code on Solaris. This did
	not happen on Solaris over 20 years before...

	On Linux - on fast multi CPU machines - the probability that a
	child process from fork() starts up before the parent is 1000x higher
	than on Solaris, where 10 million tries were needed to reproduce the
	same problem.

	As a result, the FIFO in star on Linux could in rare cases (1 of 
	~ 10000 tries) even finish the 1st read() from the input file before
	the "tar"-process starts with e.g. command lines like "star -tv" or 
	"star -x". Since star introduced auto-byte-order detection and handling
	in 1985, star needs a special start up sequence to do that.

	Star introduced the FIFO in the late 1980s and the machines from that
	time did always restart the parent before the fork()ed child starts.
	The new OS behavior thus caused a situation that was not forseeable
	when the FIFO has been designed. This new OS behavior caused a
	deadlock in aprox. 1 of 10000 star calls on Linux and 1 of 10000000
	star calls on Solaris.

	Star now waits when entering the FIFO fill-process until the 
	FIFO get-process did start up before trying to wake up a waiting
	get process.

-	star: On Linux, in 1 of 1.5 million tries, star did die from SIGPIPE.
	Note that this did never happen on Solaris.

	Star now ignores SIGPIPE and it seems that this fixed the problem
	since it did not happen again after that change with even 100 million
	tries.

-	star: The debug printing for the FIFO has been enhanced to print more
	information from the FIFO control structure to make it easier to debug
	problems like the ones mentioned above.

-	star: There seems to be a problem in pipe handling in the Linux kernel.
	It seems that in rare cases, the read(2) on a pipe returns 0 even though
	the write side did write(2) one byte to the pipe just before calling
	exit(). Unfortunately, this problem is hard to debug as it happens only
	once every ~30 million tries. Our workaround is to behave as if the
	expected byte could be read and star currently prints something like:

		star: Erfolg. Sync pipe read error pid 8141 ret 0
		star: Erfolg. Ib 0 Ob 1 e 0 p 1 g 0 chan 5.
		star: Erfolg. Trying to work around Kernel Pipe botch.

	before it continues. Since the star exit code in such a case is 0,
	we assume that this is a correct workaround and this case thus may
	be made completely silent in the future.

-	star: an even less frequent FIFO problem (occurs once every 50 million
	tries on fast multi CPU machines) has been identified. Star reports a
	hard EOF on input even though the complete file with logical EOF has
	been read and there is still input to process. In order to debug this
	problem a debug message has been added to the code.

	With this debug message, it turned out, that this problem happened
	because a context switch occurred in the FIFO read process after it did
	see an empty FIFO and later, after the process was resumed, the
	following check for the FIFO_MEOF flag did see EOF. We now first check
	for the FIFO_MEOF flag and later for the amount of data inside as the
	FIFO as FIFO_MEOF is set after the FIFO content has been updated and
	thus a context switch is no longer able to cause a wrong assumption
	about the content of the FIFO.

	If you still see this, please send a report.

-	star: added support to print debug malloc statistics to better debug
	memory problems in star.

-	star: pathname.c:: free_pspace() now only frees the path buffer if it
	is != NULL

-	star: fixed a bug in the file create.c that caused star to incorrectly
	grow the path buffer by 2 bytes for every archived file. This caused
	star to constantly grow if a larger amount of files are archived and
	eat up all memory available to 32 bit processes if the archived
	filesystem is larger than approx. 1 TB.

-	star: If the path name now cannot be handled because of low memory,
	we print a warning that includes the text "out of memory".

-	star: Now checking whether open of /dev/null failed while running a
	compress pipe. This avoids a core dump on defective OS installations.

	Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for poiting to a related Coverity message.

-	star: props.c: Added a missing /* FALLTHROUGH */ comment. 

	Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for poiting to a related Coverity message.

-	star: create.c: Add more comment for the CPIO CRC format handler to
	explain why the last instance if a series of hard links for a file
	needs to archive the data.

-	star: diff.c: added a filling fillbytes(&finfo, ...) to make sure that
	ACL pointers are initialized.

	Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for poiting to a related Coverity message.

-	star: Several /* NOTREACHED */ comments have been added to tell
	programs like coverity that after a NULL pointer check, there is no
	continuation of the program

	Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for poiting to a related Coverity message.

-	star: extract.c: A if (path->ps_path == '\0') has been corrected to
	if (path->ps_path[0] == '\0') after a mktemp() call. This was a typo
	introduced with the new support for extremely long path names.

	Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for poiting to a related Coverity message.

-	star: extract.c An initalization for a struct pathstore has been
	moved to the front to verify that path.ps_path is always initialized.

	Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for poiting to a related Coverity message.

-	star: header.c: isgnumagic(&ptb->dbuf.t_vers) has been changed to
	isgnumagic(ptb->ustar_dbuf.t_magic) as it is a "ustar" structure
	that is going to be checked.

	Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for poiting to a related Coverity message.

-	star: some Cstyle changes

-	star: another similar problem has been fixed already in the 2019-01-22
	release:

	An even less frequent FIFO problem (occurs once every 50 million
	tries on fast multi CPU machines) has been identified. Star reports a
	hard EOF on input even though the complete file with logical EOF has
	been read and there is still input to process. In order to debug this
	problem a debug message has been added to the code.

	With this debug message, it turned out, that this problem happened
	because a context switch occurred in the FIFO read process after it did
	see an empty FIFO and later, after the process was resumed, the
	following check for the FIFO_MEOF flag did see EOF. We now first check
	for the FIFO_MEOF flag and later for the amount of data inside as the
	FIFO as FIFO_MEOF is set after the FIFO content has been updated and
	thus a context switch is no longer able to cause a wrong assumption
	about the content of the FIFO.

	We now did run 250 million tests without seeing another problem.

	If you still see this, please send a report.

-	star: Note that the debug output for this problem now has been
	disabled. If you need to debug this, call:

		smake clean COPTX=-DFIFO_EOF_DEBUG all

	in the star directory.

-	star: The message "Sync pipe read error" is no longer printed when
	the FIFO background process dies instead of sending a final wakeup.
	This is needed since there is a possibility for a context switch in
	the foreground process that can make it later wait for a wakeup while
	the background process misses to see the wait flag and just exits.

-	star: In rare conditions (once every 2 million tries), a hang could 
	occur with "star -c" if the tar process fills the FIFO and sets the
	EOF flag and then calls wait() to wait for the FIFO tape output
	process. This happens in case that the tape output did not see the
	EOF flag because it has undergone a context switch after it checked
	for the not yet existing EOF flag and before waiting for a wakeup
	from the tar FIFO fill process.

	Star now closes the sync pipes before calling wait() as this always
	wakes up the waiting other side.

	We did run another 300 million tests for this condition and did not
	see any problem now.

-	makefile system: A new file include/schily/type_val.h has been added to
	allow to use TYPE_MINVAL(), ... without a need to
	#include <schily/inttypes.h>

-	makefile system: include/schily/limits.h now contains some
	XXX_MAX/XXX_MIN fallbacks in case the related defintions are missing
	in the system include file of the current OS.

-	star: Support for base-256 numbers in timestams and uid/gid has been
	added. This has been planned in the 1990s already, when star invented
	the base-256 coding, but it has been forgotten in favor of the
	POSIX.1-2001 enhanded archive headers. Now it seems that GNU tar 
	that copied the format from star uses it for timestamps and uid/gid
	and we need to implement it in order to get archive compatibility.

	Thanks to Michal Górny (mgorny@gentoo.org) for detecting the missing
	feature.

-	star: The t_rdev field in the old star header now may use base-256
	as well.

-	star: The function stoli() added a new parameter "fieldwidth" that
	allows to configure when a "unterminated octal number" warning is
	printed. This is needed since this function is used for 8 byte and
	for 12 byte fields.

-	star: star did print archives with illegal 32 byte user/group 
	names (where the nul terminator is missing) "correctly", when in 
	list mode but it used only the first 31 bytes when extractig 
	such archives

-	star: a new function istarnumber() is used to do better heuristics on
	what a valid TAR archive is. We have some special handling to work 
	around the non-compliance of GNU tar in some known cases. If you
	discover other GNU tar archives that are not detected as TAR archive,
	please report them to help to make th eheuristics better.

	The background is to make star better in detecting fool archives.

-	star: The directory testscripts added new files:

	testscripts/not_a_tar_file1 and testscripts/not_a_tar_file3

	with correct checksums that fool tar implementations that use too
	few heuristics to identify tar archives.

-	star: fixed a bug in the FIFO related to extracting multi-volume
	archives. The bug was introduced with release 2019-02-18 and the
	effect was that the FIFO complained at the end of the last volume.

-	star/libschily: Added new error checking codes:

	"ID"	allows to control error behaviour with range errors in uid_t
		and gid_t values.

	"TIME"	allows to control error behaviour with range errors in time_t

-	star: Creating multi volume archives without using the FIFO did dump
	core. We thus no longer set mp->chreel = TRUE; when the FIFO has 
	been disabled. The related bug has been introduced in January 2012.

-	star: Creating multi volume archives with a very small volume size
	could cause a hang at the end as the function startvol() did not
	check whether the TAR process did already decide to exit while
	waiting for the TAR process to calm down (stop) before writing the
	next multi volume header. We no longer wait in this case.

-	star: exprstats() now calls fifo_exit(ret) in order to avoid a
	FIFO Sync pipe read error message in case that star was terminated
	with an error.

-	star: Since we added better Unicode support in May 2018, star did
	dump core when a multi volume header with POSIX.1-2001 extensions
	was written in multi volume create mode. We now check for NULL
	pointers before we call nameascii() to decide whether the file 
	name needs a UTF-8 translation.

-	star: Creating multi volume archives without POSIX.1-2001 support
	no longer sets POSIX.1-2001 extension flags for the volume header.

-	star: The flag XF_NOTIME now works when creating POSIX.1-2001
	extended headers and thus the 'x'-header with time stamps for the
	volume header tar header is no longer created. This avoids
	to write atime=1 for the volume number 1 since we encode the
	volume number in the otherwise useless atime of the volume header
	when in POSIX.1-1988 TAR mode.

-	star: the star.1 man page now mentions that the first tar program
	appeared in 1979 (3 years before star has been started as a project).

-	star: the star.4 man page now has a "SEE ALSO", a HISTORY and
	a AUTHOR section.

-	star: the star.4 man page now has a MULTI VOLUME ARCHIVE HANDLING
	section.

-	star: the star.4 man page added a new "BASIC TAR STRUCTURE" section.

-	star: The ACL reference test archives (formerly available from e.g.:
		http://sf.net/projects/s-tar/files/alpha/) have been added
	to the directory star/testscripts/. The files 

	acl-test.tar.gz
	acl-test2.tar.gz
	acl-test3.tar.gz
	acl-test4.tar.gz
	acl-test5.tar.gz

	contain ACLs that use the obsolete method from a POSIX proposal
	from around 1993 that was withdrawn in 1997 and never has become
	part of a standard. This method has been implemented in 1993 for
	UFS on Solaris.

	GNU tar claims to support this format but really does not support
	it at all. GNU tar fails to extract the reference tar archives from
	above and it fails to create a compliant tar archive in create mode.
	It is strange to see that GNU tar never has been tested against the
	reference archives that have been created in collaboration with
	SuSE in 2001 already.

	The files

	acl-nfsv4-test.tar.gz
	acl-nfsv4-test2.tar.gz
	acl-nfsv4-test3.tar.gz
	acl-nfsv4-test4.tar.gz
	acl-nfsv4-test5.tar.gz

	contain ACLs that have become part of the NFSv4 standard and that 
	are also used on NTFS and ZFS. This format is completely unsupported
	by GNU tar.

-	star TODO: create unit tests in order to avoid future problems
	with multi volume archives similar to the problems we recently
	fixed.

-	makefile system: A new file include/schily/type_val.h has been added to

-	star TODO: create unit tests in order to avoid future problems
	with multi volume archives similar to the problems we recently
	fixed.

-	star_sym: added forgotten man page

-	autoconf/configure: Added a workaround for a Mac OS X linker bug.
	configure now always uses "rm -rf conftest*" instead of just
	"rm -f conftest*" to avoid error messages from the stray *.dSYM
	and sometimes persistent directories created by the Apple linker.

-	Makefile system: The rules for creating HTML files from man pages
	now set the troff variable "h" to 1. This is used by the SCCS
	man pages (e.g sccs-prs.1) to be able to let a wide table start
	at column 1 without letting man2html(1) result this in making the
	table entries a header (big letters).

-	Makefile system: "make tests" now implies a "make all".

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	libschily: The gethostname() emulation no longer returns ENOSYS
	if namelen is < 0. The error code now is EINVAL.

-	libschily: the lutimens() emulation no longer returns ENOSYS in case
	that the lstat() call fails, since this error code may e.g. be
	ENAMETOOLONG and used as an important indicator for long path name
	handling.

	This bug caused incorrect behavior when star extracted long pathnames
	on a platform without utimensat().

-	star: The code restructuring to openat() from Summer 2018 did not
	only cause a noticeable speed up even when not using -find, it at
	the same time resulted in a wrong error message when a file type
	was seen that is not archivable (e.g. a socket while using the USTAR
	format). The correct message was something like "Unsupported filetype",
	while the bug caused a "file not found " message. This has been fixed
	by adding a new parameter "fd" to the function stat_to_info().

-	star: header.c::get_xhtype() we did forgot to initialize:

		finfo.f_devminorbits
	and
		finfo.f_xflags

	This is now done.

-	star: The USTAR format now is able to create base-256 values in
	the field "t_devmajor". "t_devminor" did already support base-256.

-	star: The GNU tar format now is able to create base-256 values in
	the fields "t_devmajor" and "t_devminor".

-	star: The man page star.4 now mentions which fileds may have
	base-256 numbers.

-	star: The man page star.4 now longer contains the doubled "field field"
	in the explanation of the added UID/GID number for ACLs.

-	star: The man page star.4 now has a better description for the additional
	numeric fields in the ACL entries to prevent GNU tar from continuing
	with it's incompatible ACL implementation.

-	star: New ACL reference archives for the ultra compact format, that has
	been defined together with the libachive people, have been added to the
	directory testscripts/:

	acl-nfsv4-compact-test.tar.gz
	acl-nfsv4-compact-test2.tar.gz
	acl-nfsv4-compact-test3.tar.gz
	acl-nfsv4-compact-test4.tar.gz
	acl-nfsv4-compact-test5.tar.gz

-	star: Linux now uses the new <linux/fs.h> instead of <ext2/ext2_fs.h>
	to retrieve file flags.

	Thanks to a hint from Martin Matuska <martin@matuska.org> from the
	libarchive team.

-	star: Support for the following new BSD Flags:

		compressed hidden offline rdonly reparse sparse system

	has been added.

	Thanks to a hint from Martin Matuska <martin@matuska.org> from the
	libarchive team.

-	star: Support for the following new Linux flags:

		dirsync nocow notail projinherit topdir

	has been added.

	Thanks to a hint from Martin Matuska <martin@matuska.org> from the
	libarchive team.

-	star: Support for reading non-comliant libarchive tarballs that use 

		"securedeletion" or "journal"

	instead of the documented text has been added. This was used by
	libarchive until March 20, when libarchive has been fixed. We introduce
	the above names for compatibility with old TARs created by libarchive.

-	star: When an "old star" archive is read and this archive is from a system
	like FreeBSD with non-continous minor bits, star no longer warns unless
	there is a device file in the archive.

-	star: unit tests: the scripts now contain

		LC_ALL=C export LC_ALL

	instead of just LC_ALL=C to make the environment exported.

-	star/libstrar: The case where iconv() returns -1 and sets errno to E2BIG
	is now handled correctly.

-	star: The testscripts/ directory now contains the tar test archives
	from the portability tests from Michal Górny. Check

		http://cdrtools.sourceforge.net/private/portability-of-tar-features.html

	for an updated (to match star-1.6) variant of the results from the portability
	tests from Michal Górny.

-	star: older versions of star did not print the messages:

		"WARNING: Archive is 'xxx' compressed, trying to use the -xxx option.\n"

	in case that the option -print-artype was in use. Later versions that
	added support for more than "gzip" and "bzip2" forgot to add the same
	exception for the new compression methods. We now ommit this message
	for all compression types.

-	star: older versions of star did not print the messages:

		"WARNING: Archive is 'xxx' compressed, trying to use the -xxx option.\n"

	in case that an expplicit decompression option was in use. Later
	versions that added support for more than "gzip" and "bzip2" forgot to
	add the same exception for the new compression methods. We now ommit
	this message for all compression types.

-	star: Support for the "lzma" compression has been added.

-	star: Support for the "freeze2" compression has been added.

-	star: The compression method name list did not include the text "zstd".
	We added the missing text.

-	star: The hint messages that are printed when a compressed input archive
	is not seekable did forgot to mention "lzip" and "zstd". We added the
	forgotten messages.

-	star: New unit tests check whether star is able to auto-detect and auto
	decompress various compression formats.

-	star: The unit tests now include the portability tests from Michal Górny

-	A new option cli=name (must be argv[1]) allows to select all
	supported command line interfaces (star, suntar, gnutar,
	pax, cpio) when called as star.

	This is needed to be able to test all command line interfaces from
	out unit tests since star is not installed in this case and a selection
	from argv[0] would not work.

-	include/schily/dbgmalloc.h: The check for stdio.h was wrong in case that
	include/schily/dbgmalloc.h is included from include/schily/mconfig.h
	that was included from include/schily/stdio.h

-	libfind/star: the verbose listing code has ben restructured to have
		the file permissions in the same string as the file type.
		This is needed to implement the POSIX pax listformat interpreter
		format %M

-	libfind/star: the verbode listing no longer prints "l" for mandatory
		record locking for non-directory type file, but rather only
		for plain files.

-	star:	The gnutar emulation now prints the --help output to stdout as
		GNU tar.

-	star:	The gnutar.1 man page now mentions that the GNU tar
		options -g / -G did never work and it thus makes no sense to
		implement them.

-	star: very outdated code in list.c has been removed.

-	star: Added new unit tests for incremental backups and restores.
		This in special include tests that always fail with GNU tar
		as GNU tar is not usable and never was usable for incremental
		restores in case that the differences are more than trivial.

-	star: new version date 2019-04-01



TODO: 

	-	implement support for NFSv4 system attributes

	-	implement support for Trusted Solaris

	-	Complete the man page for spax

	-	Implement multi volume continuation headers that work for
		files > 8 GB where the last tar header
		(a POSIX.1-2001 'x'-header) was split across volumes.
		In this case, if only POSIX compliant TAR features are allowed,
		the extracting TAR would not be able to correctly skip the
		large file as it does not know the content of the POSIX.1-2001
		'x'-header. For this reason, later star versions need to implement
		a method to create multi volume continuation (skip) headers that
		include the size of the split POSIX.1-2001 'x'-header and the
		size of the following large file.

		Note that even with this method we would need a new method
		(different from the current bitmap) to deal with multi volume
		continuation headers for split files in case the FIFO in star
		may be larger than 8 GB.

	-	Implement an autoconf extension to to deal with Linux with XFS
		where not all ACL handling is inside -lacl ??? is this still true?

-------------------------------------------------------------
Star is the fastest known implementation of a tar archiver.

Star development started 1982, the first complete implementation has 
been done in 1985. I never did my backups with other tools than star.

Its main advantages over other tar implementations are:

	fifo			- keeps the tape streaming.
				  This gives you faster backups than
				  you can achieve with ufsdump, if the
				  size of the filesystem is > 1 GByte.

	remote tape support	- a fast RMT implementation that has no
				  probems to saturate a 100 Mb/s network.
				  in the mid 1990s and today is evenmuch
				  faster.

	selectable cli		- star cli=xxx allows to select a command
				  line interface from the list "star",
				  "suntar", "gnutar", "pax", "cpio".

	accurate sparse files	- star is able to reproduce holes in sparse
				  files accurately if the OS includes 
				  the needed support functions. This is
				  currently true for Solaris-2.3 to
				  Solaris-2.5.1

	pattern matcher		- for a convenient user interface
				  (see manual page for more details).
				  To archive/extract a subset of files.

	sophisticated diff	- user tailorable interface for comparing
				  tar archives against file trees
				  This is one of the most interesting parts
				  of the star implementation.

	no namelen limitation	- Before July 2018, star did archive and extract
				  Pathnames up to 1024 Bytes. Since July 2018,
				  star deals  with long names of arbitrary
				  length. The same limitation applies to
				  linknames.

	deals with all 3 times	- stores/restores all 3 times of a file
				  (even creation time)
				  With POSIX.1-2001 the times are in nanosecond
				  granularity.
				  Star may reset access time after doing
				  backup. On Solaris this can be done without
				  changing the ctime.

	does not clobber files	- more recent copies on disk will not be 
				  clobbered from tape
				  This may be the main advantage over other
				  tar implementations. This allows
				  automatically repairing of corruptions
				  after a crash & fsck (Check for differences
				  after doing this with the diff option).

	automatic byte swap	- star automatically detects swapped archives
				  and transparently reads them the right way

	automatic format detect	- star automatically detects several common
				  archive formats and adopts to them.
				  Supported archive types are:
				  Old tar, gnu tar, ansi tar, star,
				  POSIX.1-2001 PAX, Sun's Solaris tar.


	automatic compression detect - star automatically detects whether the
				  archive is compressed. If it has been
				  compressed with a compression program that
				  is compatible to decompression with "gzip".
				  "bzip2", "lzop", "p7zip", "xz", "zstd",
				  ...,, star automatically activates
				  decompression for 14 different compression
				  types.

	fully ansi compatible	- Star is fully ANSI/Posix 1003.1 compatible.
				  See README.otherbugs for a complete
				  description of bugs found in other tar
				  implementations. Star is the first tar
				  implementation that supports POSIX.1-2001.

	support for ACLs and file flags - star supports Access Control Lists
				  with the withdrawn POSIX method and the
				  NFSv4 standard ACL method as well as
				  extended file flags (as found on FreeBSD
				  and Linux). Support to archive and restore
				  other file properties may be easily added.
				  NFSv4 ACLs and the deprecated POSIX draft
				  ACLs are supported.

	support for all inode metadata - star supports to put all inode
				  metadata on the archive. This allows future
				  versions of star to perform true
				  incremental dumps.

	sophisticated error control - allows to tell star which error types
				  should be ignored for wich file name pattern.
				  This allows to write backup scripts that give
				  no error messages for all problems that are
				  tolerable (e.g. growing log files).

	ED like filename substitution - star supports automated pattern rule based
				  file name substitution as documented for 'pax'.

	A fast built in -copy mode - allows to make fast and accurate copies and
				  directory tree comparisons.

	Integrated find(1) code - allows many interesting new features that would
				  be possible with a separate find call.

Have a look at the manual page, it is included in the distribution.
